But when I was introduced to the Conscious Uncoupling process, I took a leap of faith, transitioned out of an unhappy marriage and stepped into my own personal power. That’s where and when my transformation began.\n\nToday I’m living my best life! I now live an expanded new life in a beautiful home where I love entertaining friends and getting to know new ones too. I am blessed to be able to travel often to interesting places around the world, soaking up different cultures and learning about their cuisines. I have successfully redefined my relationship with my former partner and am slowly building the foundation for a deep and lasting friendship.\n\nMostly, I feel blessed for my own profound personal transformation and for the opportunity to restart my life and create the next chapter. Best of all, as a Conscious Uncoupling and Relationship Coach, I have the honor of doing this joyful, hopeful work that allows me to help to heal heartbreak at its core. Trust me, you can make this shift in your life too!"
